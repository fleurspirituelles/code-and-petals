                        Nelumbo nucifera, also known as sacred lotus, Laxmi lotus, Indian lotus,
                    or simply lotus, is one of two extant species of aquatic plant in the family Nelumbonaceae. It is
                    sometimes colloquially called a water lily, though this more often refers to members of the family
                    Nymphaeaceae.

                    the family Asteraceae, often considered the archetypal species of the name daisy. To distinguish
                    this species from other plants known as daisies, it is sometimes qualified as common daisy, lawn
                    daisy or English daisy.
